# Codex OpenAI/Ollama Proxy

FastAPI-based proxy that exposes OpenAI-compatible and Ollama-compatible endpoints while using Codex/ChatGPT-backed authentication.

This repository is actually working. It is not a mockup or placeholder project.  
It supports normal chat, streaming, reasoning controls, structured tool calling, OpenAI Responses passthrough, OpenAI-compatible chat completions, and Ollama-compatible chat/generate APIs.  
That makes it useful for many AI coding agents and assistants, not just one specific client. It can be used from tools that speak OpenAI-compatible APIs, tools that speak Ollama-compatible APIs, and direct API clients that need structured function/tool calls.  
It has been tested on Windows and Apple Silicon Mac.

## Client Compatibility

The proxy is designed for agentic coding workflows and assistant clients that can point at a custom OpenAI-compatible or Ollama-compatible base URL.

Known useful client categories include:

- OpenAI-compatible coding agents such as Cline, Roo Code, Continue, and similar IDE assistants
- GitHub Copilot-style clients that use OpenAI Responses or chat-completion-style wire formats
- Raycast AI and other desktop assistants that use Ollama/OpenAI-style chat APIs with tools
- the actual `ollama` CLI and Ollama-aware apps through `/api/chat`, `/api/generate`, `/api/tags`, `/api/show`, and related endpoints
- custom scripts or backend services that need structured tool/function calling through OpenAI-compatible chat completions
- direct OpenAI Responses API clients that want a mostly passthrough `/v1/responses` endpoint backed by Codex authentication

Compatibility is implemented at two levels:

- **OpenAI-compatible mode** exposes `/v1/chat/completions`, `/v1/responses`, `/models`, and related routes for agents that expect OpenAI-style APIs.
- **Ollama-compatible mode** exposes `/api/chat`, `/api/generate`, `/api/tags`, `/api/show`, and related routes for clients that normally talk to a local Ollama server.

The goal is protocol compatibility rather than client-specific hacks. For example, `/v1/responses` stays a passthrough-style route, while the chat/Ollama adapters normalize only the request shapes that must be translated before sending them to the Codex backend.

**Prerequisite: Codex must already be installed and logged in on the machine, and a valid `auth.json` must already exist before you run this proxy. The default expected location is `~/.codex/auth.json`. Without that file, this proxy cannot authenticate to the Codex backend.**

## Run

Fresh setup:

Linux/macOS:

```bash
./install-proxy.sh
```

Windows:

```bat
install-proxy.bat
```

The install script:

- checks whether `uv` is already installed
- installs `uv` first if it is missing
- creates `.venv` then installs everything needed

Start the proxy after installation:

Linux/macOS:

```bash
./run-proxy.sh
```

Windows:

```bat
run-proxy.bat
```

Test page:

```text
http://localhost:8888/chat-test
```

If you changed `PORT`, open the same path on that port instead.

The proxy reads configuration from `.env` file if it exists.
If you do not provide a `.env` file:

- the proxy listens on `http://localhost:8888`
- incoming requests do not require an API key

## Configuration

`.env` is optional. If you do not create one, the proxy uses the built-in defaults above.

Example `.env` with custom settings:

```env
PORT=8888
CODEX_AUTH_PATH=~/.codex/auth.json
API_KEY=ENTER_YOUR_DESIRED_API_KEY_HERE
DEBUG=false
DISABLE_COPILOT_ADAPTATIONS=true
ADD_DEFAULT_RESPONSES_INSTRUCTIONS=true
```

**Important: `API_KEY` here is not an OpenAI API key. It is simply a password-like token that you choose yourself to protect access to this proxy's incoming endpoints. You might not need to set `API_KEY` if you only use this locally.**

If you want to mirror Ollama's default port exactly, set:

```env
PORT=11434
```

That is useful when you want clients to talk to the proxy on the same port they normally use for Ollama.

If you set `DEBUG=true`, the proxy writes request/response trace logs for the backend-communicating endpoints to `logs/debug.log`.

`DISABLE_COPILOT_ADAPTATIONS=true` is the default. With that setting, Copilot-looking `/v1/responses` streams are returned as raw backend passthrough instead of applying the small compatibility repairs for tool-call event shape, missing `output_index`, missing function-call ids, or missing function-call status. Set it to `false` only if you need those compatibility repairs.

`ADD_DEFAULT_RESPONSES_INSTRUCTIONS=true` is the default. With that setting, `/v1/responses` requests without explicit `instructions` receive the proxy's generic default instructions before forwarding to the Codex backend. Set it to `false` only if you need strict no-instruction passthrough for requests that omit `instructions`.

Rules:

1. If `API_KEY` is set, `/health`, `/api/version`, `/api/tags`, and `/api/ps` stay public and the rest require that key.
2. If `API_KEY` is not set, the proxy allows unauthenticated access. This is the default when you have no `.env` override.

## Endpoint Policy

Public when `API_KEY` is configured:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /api/version`
- `GET /api/tags`
- `GET /api/ps`

Protected when `API_KEY` is configured:

- `GET /models`
- `GET /v1/models`
- `POST /responses`
- `POST /chat/completions`
- `POST /v1/responses`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`
- `POST /api/chat`
- `POST /api/generate`

## Implemented Endpoints

OpenAI-compatible:

- `GET /models`
- `GET /v1/models`
- `POST /responses`
- `POST /chat/completions`
- `POST /v1/responses`
- `POST /v1/chat/completions`

Ollama-compatible:

- `GET /health`
- `GET /api/version`
- `GET /api/tags`
- `GET /api/ps`
- `POST /api/chat`
- `POST /api/generate`

Client-oriented compatibility endpoints:

- `/v1/chat/completions` and `/chat/completions` support standard chat-completion request shapes, streaming, and structured tool calls.
- `/v1/responses` and `/responses` are intended for Responses-compatible clients, including Copilot-like clients that already speak that wire format.
- `/api/chat` and `/api/generate` are intended for Ollama-compatible clients, including the native `ollama` CLI when pointed at this proxy's host and port.
- `/api/tags`, `/api/show`, `/api/version`, and `/api/ps` provide the discovery metadata many Ollama clients probe before sending chat requests.

`GET /api/ps` is a compatibility endpoint for Ollama-aware clients. Unlike a real local Ollama runtime, this proxy does not know actual loaded-model residency or VRAM usage, so some fields are synthetic:

- `expires_at`: synthetic timestamp derived from proxy catalog freshness
- `size_vram`: `0` unless upstream metadata provides a value
- `size` / `digest`: placeholder values, like the existing `/api/tags` response
- `context_length`: real Codex model metadata when available

## Model Aliases

Model list is loaded dynamically from the Codex backend. Models other than `gpt-5.4` and `gpt-5.3-codex` may also appear and can often be used as long as you specify the exact model name shown by `/models`, `/v1/models`, or `/api/tags`.

If new Codex models are added later on the OpenAI Codex server, they may become available here without a separate proxy update.

For compatibility, the proxy also generates `-low`, `-medium`, `-high`, and `-xhigh` suffix aliases for every dynamically discovered base model. However, this project is primarily designed and tested around `gpt-5.4` and `gpt-5.3-codex`, so behavior for other models is best-effort only and is not guaranteed, especially for `reasoning_effort`, `think`, `temperature`, and related compatibility details. The suffix aliases should likewise be considered reliable only for `gpt-5.4` and `gpt-5.3-codex`.

If your client supports explicit reasoning controls:

- use `reasoning_effort` on OpenAI-compatible routes
- use `think` on Ollama-compatible routes

If your client does not support those parameters, you can select the reasoning level directly by putting a suffix on the model name.

Examples:

- `gpt-5.4-low`
- `gpt-5.4-high`
- `gpt-5.3-codex-xhigh`

Well-tested model names:

- `gpt-5.4`
- `gpt-5.4-low`
- `gpt-5.4-medium`
- `gpt-5.4-high`
- `gpt-5.4-xhigh`
- `gpt-5.3-codex`
- `gpt-5.3-codex-low`
- `gpt-5.3-codex-medium`
- `gpt-5.3-codex-high`
- `gpt-5.3-codex-xhigh`

Notes:

- the suffix-free names `gpt-5.4` and `gpt-5.3-codex` use the base model without forcing a suffix-based reasoning level
- the suffix variants force `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `xhigh`
- there is no `*-none` suffix alias; if you need explicit `none`, send `reasoning_effort: "none"` on OpenAI-compatible routes or `think: false` / `think: "none"` on Ollama-compatible routes
- the full currently exposed model list is dynamic, so check `/models`, `/v1/models`, or `/api/tags` instead of relying on a hardcoded list in this README
- if the raw JSON from `/models`, `/v1/models`, or `/api/tags` is hard to scan, loading `/chat-test` might be an easier way to inspect the current model list in a simple GUI

    ]
  }'
```

    ]
  }'
```

    "prompt": "Hello!"
  }'
```

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8888/api/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer ENTER_YOUR_DESIRED_API_KEY_HERE" \
  -d '{
    "model": "gpt-5.4",
    "think": "high",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ]
  }'
```

## Validation

Current test suite:

```bash
uv run --extra dev pytest
```

## Notes

- `POST /responses` and `POST /v1/responses` forward the incoming OpenAI Responses request body to the Codex backend without converting it to chat completions or Ollama format. The upstream response body is also relayed as-is, including raw JSON and SSE streams.
- On the pass-through Responses routes, if `reasoning.effort` is missing or empty, the proxy fills it with `xhigh` before forwarding the request.
- Ollama-compatible requests accept an optional `think` parameter: `true`, `false`, `none`, `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`. `true` maps to `medium`, and `false` and `none` are treated the same.
- `temperature` is guaranteed only for `gpt-5.4` base-model requests when effective reasoning is `none`. Other dynamically discovered models currently follow the same general rule on a best-effort basis, but that behavior is not guaranteed.
